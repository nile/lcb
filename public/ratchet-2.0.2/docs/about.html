        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The idea for Ratchet was developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/connors">@connors</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dhg">@dhg</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fat">@fat</a> in mid-2012. Before it became a full fledged framework, Ratchet began as a series of HTML/CSS prototypes of the Twitter for iPhone app. These prototypes became invaluable to the process of testing new feature designs that ended up being shipped as part of the native mobile app.</p>
        <p>As it became clear that this was the quickest and most effective way to design mobile apps, components were abstracted from these prototypes and became the framework you know today.</p>
        <p>Released in November 2012, Ratchet quickly became one of the most popular prototyping tools on GitHub. Following that initial launch, we released v2 &#8211; a complete rewrite. With v2 we've abstracted the platform specific styles into their own theme CSS files, added an icon set called Ratchicons, and offically became part of the Bootstrap family.</p>
